## Problem Statement: 
India witnesses over 4.6 lakh road accidents every year, leading to significant fatalities due to delayed emergency response. Traditional systems rely on human intervention, manual
reporting, and are reactive instead of being predictive. Emergency response delays due to lack of real-time accident detection and severity estimation. No integrated platform is present that combines vehicle data, video, audio, and crowd-aid to trigger timely
interventions.

## Current Issues:
1. Lack of real-time, automated accident detection mechanisms. 
2. No predictive estimation of accident severity or victim conditions.
3. Delayed ambulance dispatch and poor routing decisions cause avoidable deaths.
4. Absence of unified integrated systems integrating visual, audio, and sensor-based accident evidence. 
5. Need for a scalable, intelligent, city-wide system that reduces response time and improves post-accident outcomes
